<h2> Traffic Sign Classification </h2>
In this work I make a small model for classification of different signs in road for example stop sign, walk sign, no entry sign etc.<br/>
This work is not based on any paper instead inspired by udacity nano degree program for self driving car. The blog post for this is available in Medium artical so you can check that out.
